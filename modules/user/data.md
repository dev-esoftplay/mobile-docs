# UserData

This module manages user-related data storage using a combination of `FastStorage` (MMKV), `AsyncStorage`, and a regular `Storage` (likely a wrapper around `AsyncStorage` or similar). It provides functions for registering, unregistering, and deleting user data associated with specific keys.  It also handles migrating data from an older storage mechanism.

## Installation

This module relies on `esoftplay` and `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`. Ensure they are installed:

```bash
npm install esoftplay @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
# or
yarn add esoftplay @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

## API

### `register(name: string): void`

Registers a data key.  This key is then used to track which data items are associated with the user.

### `multiRegister(names: string[]): Promise<void>`

Registers multiple data keys at once.  This is more efficient than calling `register` repeatedly.

### `unregister(name: string): void`

Unregisters a data key.

### `deleteAll(): void`

Deletes all user-related data associated with the registered keys.  This includes data stored in `FastStorage`, `AsyncStorage`, and the regular `Storage`.  It also triggers a reset for global user data dependencies.

## Functionality

1.  **Data Key Tracking:** Uses `FastStorage` to store a list of keys (`user_data_dependent`) that represent user-related data.  This list is used to efficiently delete all user data.

2.  **Data Migration:**  The immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) at the top of the module migrates data keys from an older `AsyncStorage` location (`user_data_dependent`) to the new `FastStorage` location.  This ensures backward compatibility.

3.  **Registration:** The `register` function adds a new key to the `user_data_dependent` list in `FastStorage`.

4.  **Multi-Registration:** The `multiRegister` function efficiently adds multiple keys to the `user_data_dependent` list, avoiding duplicate entries.

5.  **Unregistration:** The `unregister` function removes a key from the `user_data_dependent` list.

6.  **Data Deletion:** The `deleteAll` function retrieves the list of data keys, then iterates through them and removes the corresponding data from `AsyncStorage`, `FastStorage`, and `Storage`. It also calls a `userDataReset` function (presumably from global state management) for each registered key.

## Important Considerations

*   **Storage Mechanisms:** Uses three different storage mechanisms: `FastStorage` (MMKV), `AsyncStorage`, and a regular `Storage`.  Understand the differences between these storage options and choose the appropriate one for your data.  MMKV is generally faster for frequent reads and writes.
*   **Data Key Management:**  The `user_data_dependent` list is crucial for tracking user-related data.  Make sure keys are registered correctly.
*   **Data Migration:** The migration logic ensures that existing data is not lost when switching to the new storage mechanism.
*   **`userDataReset`:** The `userDataReset` function is likely related to global state management and is called to reset any dependent data when user data is deleted.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** The module uses Promises for asynchronous storage operations.
*   **Error Handling:** Basic error handling is present in `multiRegister`, but more robust error handling could be added.
*   **Dependencies:**  The module relies on `esoftplay`, `FastStorage`, `AsyncStorage`, and `Storage`.
*   **Data Consistency:** Be aware of potential data consistency issues when using multiple storage mechanisms.
*   **Storage Choices:**  The module uses a combination of `FastStorage`, `AsyncStorage`, and a regular `Storage`.  This might be due to historical reasons or specific requirements.  Consider consolidating to a single storage mechanism (e.g., MMKV) if possible to simplify the code and improve performance.
* **`userDataReset` Function:** The `userDataReset` function, used within the `deleteAll` method, is crucial for resetting any dependent data in other parts of the application.  It suggests a global state management approach where other modules might rely on the user data being deleted.  The fact that it's an array of functions hints at multiple modules potentially needing to reset their state.
* **Data Migration Strategy:** The data migration logic is important for ensuring a smooth transition when storage mechanisms change.  The module reads the list of keys from the old `AsyncStorage` location and then saves it to the new `FastStorage` location. This ensures that the tracked data keys are preserved.
* **Storage Key Consistency:** Ensure that the keys used for storing data in `FastStorage`, `AsyncStorage`, and `Storage` are consistent and match the keys registered using `register` or `multiRegister`.
* **Error Handling in `multiRegister`:**  The `multiRegister` function includes a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors during the storage operations.  This is a good practice to prevent the application from crashing.
* **Asynchronous Operations:** The module uses Promises to handle asynchronous storage operations. This is important for ensuring that the operations are completed before the next steps are executed.
* **Efficiency of `multiRegister`:** The `multiRegister` function is more efficient than calling `register` multiple times because it retrieves the list of keys only once and then performs the updates in a single operation.  This can improve performance, especially when registering a large number of keys.
